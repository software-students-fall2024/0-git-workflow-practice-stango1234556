The article that I have chosen is ***Video Game Developers Are Leaving The Industry And Doing Something, Anything Else***. I chose this article because the video game industry is one that I am interested and want to work in. However, when I constantly see the news reporting employees being laid off and how the industry, in some ways, is suffering, I become more unsure and hesitant. I also think that reading the experiences of other people in the industry and how they ultimately decided to leave not just the video game industry, but the tech industry as a whole could help me gain a better perspective of what the environment is like.

*Leanne Lu:* I'm also interested in the video game industry, and I found this article disheartening because of the way it details the dismal state of the games and tech industries, but also simultaneously inspiring, with its reminder that even if a career in these industries doesn't work out, there will always be more paths in life that you can take.
